# WOTD - Word Of The Day

Every time you open a new tab you'll get a new word in your preferred foreign language.

**Note:** By now only Finnish is supported. Feel free to edit `entries.txt` accordingly.

The expected format of each entry is `word [some etymology] : translation`.
Examples:
```
aalto [from Gmc. Cf. Icl alda] : wave
aamu [from PU *oma. Cf. Hun o (ancient)] : morning
aapa [cf. Lap ahpi (sea)] : swamp
```
